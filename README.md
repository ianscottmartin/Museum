# Breath of the Wild

This is a companion single page app for additional information while playing Zelda. This app features Monsters and treasure that can be found within the game.
The app uses an api from Hyrule Compendium API ("https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/).

The app contains several event listeners to highlight infomation found in the game. The landing page displays the many creatures and treasure one can find within the game. If you mouse-over on the creatures a description will appear. If you click the treasure, it reveals places it can be located. It is a quick and easy way to make exhilarating adventures.
